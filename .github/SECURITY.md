# Security Policy

Firstly, thanks for helping make GCE A Levels safe for everyone!

If you believe you've found a vulnerability in our bot, please report it to us as described below.

<details>

<summary>How do I know I've found a vulnerability?</summary>

Ask yourself these questions:

- Can I access something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?
- Can I change the functionality of the bot?

If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, you're probably dealing with a vulnerability.
Even if you answered 'no' to all questions, you might still be dealing with a vulnerability.
If you're unsure, send a DM to `anipalur` on Discord.
